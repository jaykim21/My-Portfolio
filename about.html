                <div>
                    <p>I’m Jaykim Alivio, a WordPress Developer with two years of experience, passionate about crafting interactive and engaging web experiences. My journey into technology began with my sister, a senior full-stack web developer. Watching her transform lines of code into fully functional applications felt like witnessing magic. The way she could solve problems and build solutions from scratch fascinated me, but at the time, it seemed like an impossible skill to master.</p>
                    <p>Everything changed in 2021 when I came across a friend’s website about our country. That moment opened my eyes to the true power of technology—how a simple website could tell a story, connect people, and make an impact. Inspired, I dove headfirst into self-learning, starting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. What began as curiosity quickly became a deep passion. I became obsessed with understanding how everything worked, from front-end design to back-end functionality.</p>
                    <p>Since then, I’ve spent countless hours honing my skills, pushing myself to improve with every project I build. Over the past two years as a WordPress Developer, I’ve worked on creating dynamic, user-friendly websites that enhance user engagement and functionality. But I know this is just the beginning. To deepen my knowledge and expand my expertise, I enrolled in a web development bootcamp, where I’m gaining hands-on experience, refining my problem-solving skills, and learning best practices from industry professionals.</p>
                    <p>My ultimate goal is to become a senior full-stack developer, just like my sister—but in my own unique way. I’m not just learning for the sake of learning; I want to build applications that solve real-world problems, create seamless user experiences, and contribute to innovative projects that push the boundaries of what’s possible.</p>
                    <p>The journey is challenging, but I embrace every obstacle as an opportunity to grow. Every line of code, every late-night debugging session, and every new skill I acquire brings me one step closer to that goal. With dedication, persistence, and an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, I know I will one day achieve my dream. Until then, I’m committed to learning, building, and making a meaningful impact in the tech industry.</p>
